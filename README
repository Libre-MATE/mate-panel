mate-panel
===========

mate-panel contains the MATE panel, the libmate-panel-applet library and
several applets:

  + the MATE panel is the area on your desktop from which you can run
    applications and applets, and perform other tasks.

  + the libmate-panel-applet library allows to develop small applications
    which may be embedded in the panel. These are called applets.
    Documentation for the API is available with gtk-doc.

  + the applets supplied here include the Workspace Switcher, the Window
    List, the Window Selector, the Notification Area, the Clock and the
    infamous 'Wanda the Fish'.

mate-panel is a fork of gnome-panel.
